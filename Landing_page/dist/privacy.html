        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Working Well (“we”, “our” or “us”)
          discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the
          information in connection with your use of
          [http://www.lightandfit.com/] (the “Site”) and the associated Slack
          app, features and content (the “Services”).

          >What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong
        >
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable
          information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties
          that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third
          party websites, services and applications that you elect to access
          through Slack or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While
          we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services
          that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility
          for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We
          encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third
          Party Services you access.

          What Information Do We Collect?</strong
        >
        <p>
          Working Well is simply here to help you incorporate wellness practices
          into your workday . The only data retained by Working Well is your
          team webhook url (which is required to post Working Well messages to
          your Slack). This information is the only information we need from
          Slack to make the service available to you. We do not collect any
          other personal information about you from Slack. Furthermore, all
          other data resulting from your use of Slack is not visible to us, such
          as all your messages in your chats and channels.

          <em>Third party providers:</em>
          Working Well does not display advertising and does not pass on any
          data to advertisers or other providers with commercial interests. No
          data will be passed on to third parties for any other purpose than the
          functional provision of the service itself. For the functional
          provision of the service we work together with the developer Working
          Well to build and maintain the app. The developer does not collect any
          data, just ensures the app functions properly. Email, Text, and Push
          Notification Communications: We may communicate with you via push
          notification, to the extent you permit us to do so.

          <em>Aggregate Information:</em>
          We collect statistical information about how many users download the
          app. This statistical information is not Personal Information and
          cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.
        </p>
        <strong style="color:whitesmoke;">How Can I Delete The App?</strong>
        <p>
          Should you ever decide to stop using the Slack app, you may do so
          through Slack, by withdrawing from the Slack channel housing the app
          or by deleting the app plugin.
        </p>
        <strong style="color:whitesmoke;">
          Update of the data protection information</strong
        >
        <p>
          If necessary due to legal changes or as soon as changes in the data
          processing carried out by us make this necessary, we will adapt these
          instructions. Therefore Light + Fit asks you to inform yourself
          regularly about the content. As soon as the changes make it necessary
          for you to cooperate (e.g. consent) or any other individual
          notification, we will of course inform you immediately.
        </p>
        <strong strong style="color:whitesmoke;"
          >What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</strong
        >
        <p>
          If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the
          Slack app, please send us a detailed message to [CUSTOMER SERVICE
          EMAIL]. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
