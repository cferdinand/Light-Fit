        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable
          information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties
          that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third
          party websites, services and applications that you elect to access
          through Slack or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While
          we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services
          that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility
          for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We
          encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third
          Party Services you access.

          What Information Do We Collect?</strong
        >
        <p>
          Working Well is simply here to help you incorporate wellness practices
          into your workday. We'll receive the authentication token, the user
          name, and the workspace channel from Slack and store that in our
          database. Besides that, we won't have access to any other data (or any
          sensitive data). This information is the only information we need to
          make the service available to you. This information shall not be used
          for any external purposes, it will only be used to make the service
          available to you and to track the amount of app downloads. Webhook
          URLs and download counts collected will only be accessible by the
          brand, agency partner, and developers . We do not collect any other
          personal information about you from Slack.

          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, all other data resulting from your use of Slack is not
          visible to us, such as all your messages in your chats and channels.
        </p>

        <em style="color:whitesmoke">Third party providers:</em>

        <p>
          Working Well does not display advertising and does not pass on any
          data to advertisers or other providers with commercial interests. No
          data will be passed on to third parties for any other purpose than the
          functional provision of the service itself. For the functional
          provision of the service we work together with the developer Working
          Well to build and maintain the app. The developer does not collect any
          data, just ensures the app functions properly.
        </p>

        <em style="color:whitesmoke">Email, Text, and Push:</em>
        <p>
          Notification Communications: We may communicate with you via push
          notification, to the extent you permit us to do so.
        </p>

        <em style="color:whitesmoke">Aggregate:</em>
        <p>
          Information: We collect statistical information about how many users
          download the app. This statistical information is not Personal
          Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web
          browser.

          >How Can I Delete The App?</strong
        >
        <p>
          Should you ever decide to stop using the Working Well app, you may do
          so through Slack, by withdrawing from the Slack channel housing the
          app or by deleting the app plugin.

          Update of the data protection information</strong
        >
        <p>
          If necessary due to legal changes or as soon as changes in the data
          processing carried out by us make this necessary, we will adapt these
          instructions. Therefore Light + Fit asks you to inform yourself
          regularly about the content. As soon as the changes make it necessary
          for you to cooperate (e.g. consent) or any other individual
          notification, we will of course inform you immediately.
